# Pages

The frontend project has the following pages:

## Repository

### List repositories page

URL: `/repositories`

List all the configured repositories in the project from the repository service, allowing user to add, edit, and delete repositories. The page should also allow user to select a repository to view its details.

By clicking on the "Add Repository" button, user will be redirected to the "Add Repository" page, which should be added later in a
separate PR.
Clicking on any repository will redirect user to the "Repository Details" page, which should be added later in a separate PR.
